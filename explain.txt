# make
    make clean  - clear everything
    make debug  - make the debugger
    make        - make the game

# rand
    v1 = rand() % 100;         // v1 in the range 0 to 99
    v2 = rand() % 100 + 1;     // v2 in the range 1 to 100
    v3 = rand() % 30 + 1985;   // v3 in the range 1985-2014

# Constructs
    Pointstruct is the lowest form of construct (responsible for color, glyph, pos)
    basic unit is a Construct
    Room is a special construct that cleans up the look when finished
    
# Arrays
    construct_array - used to keep track of the structures that are blocking (stored in here since they wont move)
    PT_array        - actual array of pointstructs 
    NOTE: must load both when adding a structure

# Builds 
    0----0  w:6 h:4 
    |    |  it will be built by going
    |    |  (0 to 5) 0----0, (1 to 2) | |
    0----0  (5 to 0) 0----0, (2 to 1) | |

# Land
    Landtiles represent a section of Land
    Land is represent by
        a base material (dirt, rocks, sand)
        a plant material (grass, shrubs, moss, coral)
    each Landtile has the potential to grow certain plants
    when plants are removed or picked the base material still remains

# World
    contains multiple MapSlices

# MapSlices
    contains all the info for creatures, buildings, etc in that slice
    is responsible for updating creatures
    is responsible for pathfinding arrays

# Thought
    Thoughts dictate what the being will do
    most component will have a specific thought as a condition for being updated

# Components
    some components will add a possible thought to the being

    movement component:
        L reacts to State
        L reacts to moveto position

    start   --->    no thought  --->    no thought
                    no thought  --->    BUILD (job thought) 
                                            L MOVE state
